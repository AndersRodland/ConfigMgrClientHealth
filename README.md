## Changes since stable release

* Client Health now successfully sets the client max log history.
* Client Health now successfully sets the client cache size.
* Fixed an issue where ClientInstallProperty using /skipprereq and specifying multiple components while separating with ";" would break the script.
* Updated criteria for excluding Defender signature updates in the Get-LastInstalledPatches function. Thanks to Scott Ladewig.
* Enabled debug logging in the webservice by default to make troubleshooting easier. Debug logs are stored in the "logs" folder.
